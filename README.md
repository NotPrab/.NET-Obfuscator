# Introduction

## 1) What is .NET Obfuscator?
 
In Generally, an Obfuscator is a tool used to increase the security of a program by making the code more compilcated to read while retaining functionality. NET Obfuscator is a specific tool for .NET Programs.

## 2) Why do we need to use Obfuscator ?

1.) It's essential to hide bussiness logic and code to make it harder for attackers to gain access and start debugging and tampering with your app.
 
2.) Code obfuscation can drastically reduce file size, and download times can be reduced drastically as well.

3.) People are making careers out of reverse engineering- Therefore, you want to make it difficult as possible to deter them.

4.) A company developing applications for clients may not want their clients to be able to read them.
